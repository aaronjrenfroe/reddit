in /etc/hosts add a new entry:
  [ip] reddit.local

navigate to reddit.local and you should see the reddit home 

when attempting too register a new user you get an message saying "an error has occured"
this is becasue theh https certs are bad
navigate to https://reddit.local

Add TSL/SSL exception attempt to create a new user again.

You might get a "server 500 error" message. I have not tracked this one down yet but
you should be able to login anyway with the username and password that you just made. 

Once logged in you cannot create a subreddit for 30 days and the site has 0 admins, so lets change that. 
 - navigate to ./reddit/src/reddit/r2/ and open example.ini
 - there are lots of fun things in here but we need to focus
 - find the that contains "reddit:admin", it's around 822
 - add a comma and add your username you created when you registered a colon and 'admin'
   - the line should look like this: 
      employees = reddit:admin, <your username>:admin
 - save the file
 - now we need to write the config to ZooKeeper (What is ZooKeeper?)
 - navigate to ./reddit/src/reddit/scripts and run: python write_live_config ./../r2/example.ini

###### TODO #####
